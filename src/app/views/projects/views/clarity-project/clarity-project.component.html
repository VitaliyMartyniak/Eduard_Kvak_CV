      <p>The client requested the design of two distinct projects: an interactive content platform and an e-book reader. The interactive
        content platform would allow users to ask questions, write articles, post videos, and engage with various content types.
        The e-book reader was to be a user-friendly application for managing and displaying the clientâ€™s e-book collection.

            In the research phase, we undertook a comprehensive analysis to gather essential insights shaping the
            project's direction. This involved studying user behaviors and preferences, examining competitors to
            discern market trends and opportunities, and conducting brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas.

        <app-expandable-section title="Ideate"
        >
          <span>
            During this phase, we closely worked with stakeholders in workshops to come up with different ideas and solutions.
            This included hosting brainstorming sessions and creating wireframes to explore different ways to design the project.
            To keep the users in mind, we thought about different situations they might encounter. Then, we chose the best ideas
            that matched project goals.

        <app-expandable-section title="Design"
        >
          <span>
            In the design phase, we crafted detailed and polished designs, refining our top ideas into visually
            compelling and user-friendly interfaces. Alongside this, we established a comprehensive UI Kit, ensuring
            consistency and efficiency across the project's design elements.

        <app-expandable-section title="Review"
        >
          <span>
            In the review phase, we carefully checked the designs by testing them and getting feedback. We did
            tests to see if everything worked well and asked stakeholders and team members for their thoughts.
            Then, we made changes to improve the designs based on the feedback we received.

          <span>
            After everything was completed, we prepared all resources and conducted a session where we presented
            the solutions to the developers, making sure they had a clear understanding of the designs and how
            to implement them accurately.

            Given the tight schedule, we focused our research on quickly gathering critical insights. We utilized analytics
            to pinpoint user pain points and identify areas where users were dropping off during the registration process.
            This data-driven approach allowed us to understand user behavior and preferences efficiently. Additionally, we
            conducted a thorough competitor analysis to understand industry standards and identify opportunities for improvement.
            These insights informed our design strategy and guided the development of a more user-friendly registration flow.

            During ideation, we held intensive brainstorming sessions to generate a variety of ideas and potential solutions.
            We collaborated closely with stakeholders to create and refine wireframes, exploring different design directions.
            We prioritized ideas based on feasibility, user impact, and alignment with project goals.

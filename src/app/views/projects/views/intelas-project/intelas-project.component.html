      <p>Explore the various stages below to gain insight into our approach and methodologies.</p>

          <span>
            We started by conducting in-depth user interviews and surveys to uncover critical insights into user needs,
            behaviors, and pain points. We performed a thorough competitor analysis to spot market trends and gaps.
          </span>
          </app-expandable-section>
          <app-expandable-section title="Ideate"
          >
          <span>
            In the ideation phase, creativity and collaboration took center stage. We hosted dynamic brainstorming
            sessions and workshops with key stakeholders to generate a broad spectrum of ideas and solutions. We
            sketched and created high-fidelity wireframes to explore various design decisions. We then prioritized
            ideas based on their feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with the project's objectives.
          </span>
          </app-expandable-section>
          <app-expandable-section title="Design"
          >
          <span>
            In the design phase, we turned our top ideas into detailed and polished designs. We created a UI Kit to ensure
            the design was consistent and efficient across the project.
          </span>
          </app-expandable-section>
          <app-expandable-section title="Prototype"

          >
          <span>
            During the prototyping phase, we brought our designs to life. We developed an interactive, functional prototype
            that not only simulated the user experience but also highlighted key functionalities. This allowed stakeholders
            to engage with a tangible representation of the final product, providing invaluable feedback for further refinement.

    <h2>Car IQ Pay</h2>

    <p class="first-article">
      Car IQ Pay is the first payment platform to enable vehicles to initiate, validate, and complete authorized transactions.
      The system eliminates the credit card completely and connects the vehicle directly to merchants to make secure and seamless
      payments. Car IQ Pay integrates with existing tech stacks and uses telematics and vehicle data to provide fleets with
      detailed insights, allowing them to follow every payment and eliminate fraud. As a result, it consolidates all transactions
      into a single ledger, reducing reconciliation and enabling fleets to manage their spending more effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time merchants in Car IQâ€™s Network can better understand their customers' needs and take advantage of
      technology-forward marketing opportunities with personalized, location-based offers tailored to the needs and preferences of individuals.
